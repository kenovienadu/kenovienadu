Hi there 👋, I'm Ken Ovienadu (he/him)

<br>

I work on a number of projects with different teams. I'm quite familiar with Javascript/Typescript and a little bit of Dart and Java.

<br>

Feel free to reach out to me if there is an interesting project we could work on or if you want to talk about your pet or football or basketball or fifa. The point is, I'm here to listen 😉
